--The following mulfunctions fixed
 -Interrupt events were not generated under the specific condition.
 -Successive interruption to the SMP environment caused blue screan.

 -The device name may not be normally displayed in the Device Manager. 
 -The last data was not transfered successfully by DMA transfer depending
  on the configured number of data.
 -If a callback function was registered by the digital input all input signals,
  the digital output callback function was called at the unexpected time 
  when a callback function was registered by the digital output interrupt event.
 -The DioSetEventEx function did not work normally if a buffer to store events were not pointed.
 -An error occured when the DioBmSetDeviceConfigEx function specifies DIOBM_LOW. 
 -When an interruption that can be used for both digital input and 
  digital output was configured, the setting value was overwritten.
 -When the DMA transfer counter counted over 8000000h of data in the DioBmGetData,
  the number of retrieved data had an error.  
 -A counter matching detection was generated at at the number of data specified 
  by the DioBmSetCounterEventConfig plus one data.
 -Input value was not retrieved when input signal and output signal are assigned 
  to different ports and used simultaneously for DMA transfer in CBI-291144.
--When sampling and successive output stopes under errornous state,
  the state is recovered by forced initialization by the DioBmClose function.
